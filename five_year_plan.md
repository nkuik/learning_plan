# Five Year Plan

At the risk of seeming entirely too much Type-A, I've put together a loose timeline for the things I'd like to work towards in the next five years. Life is unplannable, but this is at least a way for me to orient myself towards the direction I'd like to go.

## 2018

* April: Begin to meet requirements for Danish permanent residence
* September 1: Complete application for Georgia Tech's [Online Master of Science in Computer Science](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/)
* November: _Maybe_ take the [PD3](https://www.studieskolen.dk/en/Dansk-for-udlaendinge/exams/danish-3-exam) (Danish language test)
* November: Complete Modul 5 of Danish language instruction
* December: Hear about application to Masters
    - Begin meeting requirements if not accepted

## 2019
