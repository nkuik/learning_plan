# Inefficiencies
Areas I need to reduce to increase time, accuracy, and efficiency. Probably a priority to focusing on areas of increasing knowledge

## Environment
### Text Editor
- Have switched back to Sublime. Will be looking into Jupyter.

### Context Switching
- Multiple desktops, windows, programs open.

### Distractions
- Music (Spotify)
- Completely distracting sites
- Sites/topics that masquerade as productive but are just distraction

### Too much at once
- Break things down into smaller pieces

## Technical Areas

## Tools
- RescueTime
    + Will consider version with the focused feature
- Be Focused (Pomodoro)
- Todo list for smallest tasks possible
