# Inefficiencies
Areas I need to reduce to increase time, accuracy, and efficiency. Probably a priority to focusing on areas of increasing knowledge

## Environment
### Text Editor
- Have switched back to Sublime. Will be looking into Jupyter.
    + Completing problems in the interactive coding challenge repo, which uses jupyter. Haven't done much with iPython, but interested

### Context Switching
- Multiple desktops, windows, programs open.

### Distractions
- Music (Spotify)
- Completely distracting sites
- Sites/topics that masquerade as productive but are just distraction

### Too much at once
- Break things down into smaller pieces

## Technical Areas
- Lack of complex knowledge of python's inner workings
    + Leads to more ineffecient implementations that might be better done using built-in features
- Shell commands
- Things at an OS level

## Tools
- RescueTime
    + Will consider version with the focused feature
- Be Focused (Pomodoro)
- Todo list for smallest tasks possible
