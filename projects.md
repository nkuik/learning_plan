# Projects

## End-to-end deployables
These are little projects to help me become more comfortable with starting with nothing and deploying the small project, the message being that getting something into production early is a good practice. Inspiration for these came from the [list of things to build](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-secret-to-being-a-top-developer-is-building-things-heres-a-list-of-fun-apps-to-build-aac61ac0736c)
- "Hello world" Python service
    + Imports
    + Google cloud
    + Kubernetes
- Sortable drag-and-drop list
- Node.js & GraphQl
- Electron Desktop App

## Raspberry Pi
As I miss working in the Unix setting, my plan is to get a Raspberry Pi to help me get back into this kind of development. It will also help me build things. I will plan to do some of my development on this when I get it.
