# Competencies

## Effective teammate

### Communication
Communicating in a way that makes things clear and apparent when approaching and sending things to others. I have a habit of not always including the correct amount of context or background that requires less cognitive effort from teammates or managers

## Software Development

### DevOps
It is becoming clear that this is something important for all developers, as we should have an understanding for the way our work is moved into production.

### Text Editor/IDE
Make a decision regarding the IDE that I might want to write in. Using atom
currently, but thinking of switching back to Sublime.

### Documentation
Writing clear and succinct documentation is an art form. My work at DSB has required me to start this process a bit from the ground up, and it has been a great learning experience.

### Version Control
Decent understanding of this, but could increase understanding of slightly more
complex areas when it comes to branching, merging, etc. Also improving brevity
for comments, commit messages, etc.

### Automation & Script Writing
Learn to do more in the same amount of time. Get a better sense when it makes
sense to take the time to automate something vs. just doing it.

### Testing
Firming up knowledge and ability to write effective and pragmatic test. Mocking
and stubbing are two my weakest areas here.
