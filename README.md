# Learning Plan

Purpose: to create an intentional plan to develop professionally

## Current Priorities

- Learning TypeScript
- Serverless
- Event-driven architecture (and tangentially related)
  - Currently reading: [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Martin-Kleppmann/dp/1449373321/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=datenintensive+anwendungen+gestalten&qid=1673550491&sprefix=designing+d%2Caps%2C101&sr=8-1)
  - [Building Event-Driven Microservices](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/1492057894/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&psc=1)
- Finding a [tutor](./tutoring_plan.md)
- Improve my communication and collaboration. This can be done through:
  - Live/mob/pair programming
  - Workshops/learning sessions

## Goals

1. Better mastery of serverless and event-driven architecture

- Learn the "Core Serverless" principles
- [Software Architecture: The Hard Parts](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/1492086894/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&psc=1)

2. Improve presentation skills, especially regarding technical content
3. Better master of TypeScript

- Currently reading: [Effective Typescript](https://effectivetypescript.com/)
- "Everyday Typescript" ([executeprogram.com](https://www.executeprogram.com/course))
- "Advanced Typescript" ([executeprogram.com](https://www.executeprogram.com/course))

4. "Comfortable" in business-related parts of codebase

## How to get there

- Scheduling learning times in the calendar every week
- Intentionally scheduling workshops/learning sessions with teammates
- Some kind of blog writing goal, such as one blog post every 2 weeks?
