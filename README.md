# Learning Plan
Filling in the gaps after moving to software development from an unrelated
field ðŸ’ª

## Sources of Inspiration
- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)

## Plan Organization
Nothing complicated. Top level is the core competencies and topics that I'd like
to focus on, with the topics directory containing greater specificity for each
competency/topic.

These two things overlap, so the categorization will improve as I develop the
plan.
