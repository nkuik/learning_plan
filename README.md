# Learning Plan
Filling in the gaps after moving to software development from an unrelated
field üí™. Priority number one is figuring out where I'd like to go and then
figuring out what I need to focus on to get there.

## Plan
Python:
- Go through one python koan daily
- At least one chapter from python book daily
Algorithms:
- Do one algorithm daily

## Current Priorities

* Rubber duck! üê•
    - explaining things
* [Coursera ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

Easy Wins:
- General productivity
    + Staying focused
    + Avoiding distractions
    + Environment set up and workflow
- Text Editor Stuff
- Version Control

Middle Challenges:
- Learn specifics of python
- OOP

Bit further out:
- Systems design
- Algorithms

## Life Things
- Learn German
- Meditation

## Sources of Inspiration
- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
- [Competency Matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/)

## Plan Organization
Nothing complicated. Top level is the core competencies and topics that I'd like
to focus on, with the topics directory containing greater specificity for each
competency/topic.

These two things overlap, so the categorization will improve as I develop the
plan.
