# Learning Plan

Filling in the gaps after moving to software development from social work ðŸ’ª. Priority number one is figuring out where I'd like to go and then
figuring out what I need to focus on to get there. 

This relates to my biggest challenge at the moment, which happens to be deciding on [potential path](/professional_path.md) I'd like to take. The most difficult piece of this puzzle is the fork of technical and non-technical work. This doesn't mean I can only do one or the other, but it does seem that moving back into technical work after moving out of it is difficult, and I'm not sure I want to do that yet.

The two most prevalent documents are my [DSB plan](/dsb_plan.md) and my [five year plan](/five_year_plan.md).

## Workflow

I mostly use [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/about/) workflow, as I realized that I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to remember the things that I should be doing.

## Current Priorities

* Building things end-to-end, even if they are especially simple
* Learning things that can be transferred to a wide variety of domains (communication, time management, collaboration, etc.)
* Ensuring every project I start, no matter how small, is deployed somewhere

Easy Wins:
- General productivity
    + Staying focused and avoiding distractions

Middle Challenges:
- Designing fully-implemented solutions
    + My tendency is to stop when things are a bit half-baked, and I need to focus more on iterating to a more complete state before I share it or consider it ready

Bit further out:
- Systems design
- Computer Science related education

## Life Things
- Learn Danish
- Hobbies
    + Mountain Biking
    + Yoga and Meditation

## Plan Organization
Nothing complicated. Top level is the core competencies and topics that I'd like to focus on, with the topics directory containing greater specificity for each competency/topic.
