# Learning Plan
Filling in the gaps after moving to software development from an unrelated
field ðŸ’ª. Priority number one is figuring out where I'd like to go and then
figuring out what I need to focus on to get there.

## Plan
Python:
    - Go through one python koan daily
    - At least one chapter from python book daily
- Do one algorithm daily
- Complete two Sublime Tutor lessons daily

## Current Priorities
Easy Wins:
- Text Editor Stuff
- Version Control

Middle Challenges:
- Learn specifics of python
- OOP

Bit further out:
- Systems design
- Algorithms

## Sources of Inspiration

- [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
- [Competency Matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/)

## Plan Organization
Nothing complicated. Top level is the core competencies and topics that I'd like
to focus on, with the topics directory containing greater specificity for each
competency/topic.

These two things overlap, so the categorization will improve as I develop the
plan.
