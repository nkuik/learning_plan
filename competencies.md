# Competencies

## Text Editor/IDE
Make a decision regarding the IDE that I might want to write in. Using atom
currently, but thinking of switching back to Sublime.

## Version Control
Decent understanding of this, but could increase understanding of slightly more
complex areas when it comes to branching, merging, etc. Also improving succintness
for comments, commit messages, etc.

## Automation & Script Writing
Learn to do more in the same amount of time. Get a better sense when it makes
sense to take the time to automate something vs. just doing it.

## Testing
Firming up knowledge and ability to write effective and pragmatic test. Mocking
and stubbing are two my weakest areas here.
