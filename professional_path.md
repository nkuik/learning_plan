## Potential Paths

To the end of getting a better idea of directions I might want to go, here are some potential paths: 

* Project Manager (non-technical)
    - Would require me to improve my managerial and people connecting skills, as these have suffered a bit since moving away from social work
    - I would need to be careful of not getting too deep into the technical aspects of the project just because I thought it was interesting, as this could lead to micromanagement
    - Also requires some improvement of making decisions when there is limited information/unknowns
* Software Developer (technical)
    - Requires dedicated practice to improving my ability to develop
    - Possibly requires attaining another degree; would at least improve my credibility in the field
    - Important to handle the balance between hard and soft skills
* Evangelist (technical/non-technical)--or something similar
    - One with the "fuzziest" path; could be the most risky to go down this road, as I would really need to get out of my comfort zone when it comes to organizing things
    - Is of interest due to my curiosity with organizational change and development
* Therapist that can code
    - This would be a pretty long road, as I'd need to take extra courses and really improve my Danish level--if I wanted to do this in Denmark
    - It is perhaps the work that I'm most connected with, but have the least access to at the moment, since the road to receiving the correct education is unclear
