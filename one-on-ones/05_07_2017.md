# July 5 One-On-One (day after ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸŒ­ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ†)

## Things learned
- General python stuff
    + modules/file organization, list comprehensions, generators, syntax, types, libraries
- OOP
    + some systems design stuff
    + definitely want to improve this area
- APIs
    + SOAP apis
    + reading/exploring/experimenting documentation and existing systems
    + what's in documentation not necessarily reality
- Collaboration
    + git
    + written, verbal communication
- Basic data organization
    + data hierarchy
    + how not to do it
- Multifaceted reality of development
    + so many areas involved in the process
    + all are restricted/constructed by human things
        * an area of interest I have (psychology/sociology)

## Areas for growth
- Speed
    + I'm a bit slow with everything
    + text editor, command line, coding, coming up with solutions
- Communication/asking for help
    + Trying to standardize this a bit, but a work in progress
        * Working on something for about 30 minutes before asking for help
        * Trying to have specific question when asking
        * Coming with ideas and/or solutions rather than just, "What should I do?"
    + Improving the steps I take when approaching a new problem
- Command line
    + closely related to speed
- General CS stuff
    + breadth/depth
    + deciding what is valuable vs. too low level
- Breaking things down
    + often try to do too much, too soon
    + now using little todos to break things into smaller chunks
- Receiving feedback
    + don't take things personally
    + be willing to argue for/against something
- Refactoring
    + possibly one of the best ways for me to learn

## Where/how I learn
- Learning plan
- [Reading](https://github.com/nkuik/learning_plan/blob/master/currently_reading.md)
- Interactive learning
    + python koans
    + systems design and interactive coding challenges
- Videos
- Have done some online learning in the past
- Blog posts and tech reader
- Twitter
- Reddit
- Talking with other people
- Meetups
    + Pydata
    + Zalando
    + Looking for others
- Talking with other people

## Current workflow
- Document the things I do each day
    + Learning
        * Sublime
        * Python
        * Algorithms
        * Linux
    + Agenda
    + Actual Work
    + Insights
- Using todos
    + taking larger tasks and breaking them up
- Pivotal tracker
- Update learning plan

## Biggest Challenges
- Focus
    + Both attention-wise and education categories 
- Where/how should I spend my time
- Decisiveness about things I want/like to do
- Somewhat late start
- Tendency to overwork

## Where do I want to go
- Being able to just get things done
    + effectiveness
- Some combination of social science and coding, ideally
    + software for therapists?
- Interests
    + data
    + human and computer interaction
    + social impacts of technology
    + design and design thinking
    + mindfulness
    + team functioning
    + flow
- Social Change
    + having interest in areas that I used to be more involved in
    
## How can I get there?
- Getting out into the community more
    + conferences
    + talks
- Open source participation
- Personal projects
- Continued reading and study
    + [learning plan](https://github.com/nkuik/learning_plan)
