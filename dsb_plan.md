# DSB plan

Now that I'm working at [DSB](https://dsb.dk), I've started to think about the directions and topics that I'd like to learn, improve, and focus on. After a decent amount of thought, there is a position in my head that lies at the intersection of my goals and interests.

## Ideal Job

I'm not really after a job title, so I won't try to make something up. Instead, my ideal job would be a mix of the following topics:

- DevOps
- Organizational Development/Change
- Site Reliability Engineer (inspired by [this thread](https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/989603219629260800))
- Communications
- Microservices

It includes these skills/competencies:

- Programming
- Strategy
- Monitoring/Understanding
- Testing
- [Deep Work](http://www.dansilvestre.com/deep-work-cal-newport/)

## Why its relevant

It is clear that DSB needs to make many changes if it is to reach its Digitalisation goals. A huge part of this is a change in how DSB develops software. If DSB wants to move "from fragile to agile", planning, development, testing, and deployment need to be move more towards a microservice archicture that favors distributed teams and limits bottlenecks.

The movement towards [microservice software design](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)--and containerized development--requires a diverse group of people with a diverse set of skills. It is clear that simply adding in a new technology [does not automatically change an organization's culture](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3185224), but a concerted effort to change attitudes, coupled with both technologies that foster faster development and individuals that understand the importance of communication, can lead to real change.

## How I want to get there

I have many things that I'd like to learn and work on, and this is why I've taken some time to lay out a certain type of plan for getting there. This plan can be found [here](/five_year_plan.md).
