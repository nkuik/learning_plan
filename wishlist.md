# Learning Wishlist

## Time
This is actually the most important thing, because it can be difficult to dedicate time to learning when there are deadlines at work. I can pretty easily fit study time in when doing 8-hour days, but can become a stretch when doing more.

## Small
- Books
    + [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.de/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_6?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1500539794&sr=1-6&keywords=refactoring) ✅
- Udemy courses
    +  [Python OOP](https://www.udemy.com/python-beyond-the-basics-object-oriented-programming)

## Medium
- [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) Subscription
- Udemy courses
    + [Deep learning](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-deep-learning-in-python/)
    + [Deep reinforcement learning](https://www.udemy.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-python/)
    + [Convolutional neural networks](https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-convolutional-neural-networks-theano-tensorflow/)

## Large
- [Recurse Programming Retreat](https://www.recurse.com/)
    + 6 to 12 week for improving coding skills and focusing on personal projects
- Udacity Nanodegree
    + Applied for the [artificial intelligence program](https://www.udacity.com/ai) ✅
        * Costs around €1350
        * Willing to personally contribute
    + If I don't get accepted to AI, there are also data analyst and machine learning programs
        * These cost €299/month, so incentive to finish quickly
- Conferences
    + [EuroSciPY](https://www.euroscipy.org/2017/#registration)
        * Geared towards scientific use of python, so not too relevant
