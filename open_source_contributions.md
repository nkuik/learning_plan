# Contributing to Open Source
Another thing I'd like to do is start contributing to open source projects. In
fact, this might be the best way for me to learn many of these things, especially
when it comes to things like OOP and systems design.

## Possibilities
### Ruby/Rails
* [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon)
    - 600+ open issues, including a "fit for beginners" tag
* [Hound](https://github.com/houndci/hound)

## Resources
* [Dev.to blog post](https://dev.to/jess/open-source-resources-for-beginners?utm_content=bufferce45b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
