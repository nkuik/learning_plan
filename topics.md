# Topics
These are admittedly huge areas of study and learning. One of my biggest challenges
will be deciding breadth vs depth in all areas of study.

## Python
Since it's needed for my work at Twyla, it only makes sense that I should learn
it better. That, and it's a really useful and nice to write language.

## Object Oriented Programming
Been a bit poo-pooed lately, in favor of some strong opinions regarding functional
programming, but still central to a lot of software development. I need a better
understanding of OOP separated from specific frameworks, which is largely how
I've interacted with it.

## Systems Design
After learning Python and OOP more thoroughly, this is one of the most beneficial
areas for me to learn more about, since it is related to essentially every business
that is creating software.

## Data Structures
Since they are central to programming, there's always more that I can learn about
data structures. I also really don't know that much about things like trees and
graphs.

## Algorithms
These are basically all the rage for coding interviews, with some pushback, but
it's still good for me to know more about them and their underlying aspects.

## Math
My math level is currently poor, as a product of unintuitive instruction
and lack of further development. Probably most effective to study math that
is most closely related to CS stuff (), rather than less related branches.

## AI
Completely ludicrous to write this like it's such a small thing (same goes for
all of these topics). However, it's an area that I'd like to continue to understand
better.

## Data Science
I've done some basic self-study in this area, and have some background in statistics.
It's something that interests me beyond programming (e.g. data collection's and
representation's influence on society and specific people groups), and I'd like
to learn more.
