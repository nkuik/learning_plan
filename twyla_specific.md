# Twyla
Plenty of things that I'd like to learn for the things I'm working on for Twyla.
Here are the priorities:

## Topics/Things
* Get to know the code base
    - Things like:
        * Chat state
        * More on how the different pieces pass info back and forth
* Async
    - High level understanding of this, but need to write some things with it
        * Is an option for some sample code
        * See [practice code repo](https://github.com/nkuik/practice-code)
* Queue
    - Looked into AMQP
    - Need to look at more code/write more code to know this better
* Testing
    - Used to Rspec and Rails, so making the adjustment to Python
* Python
    - Better covered in the python specific section of topics
* OOP
    - As I'm more used to frameworks, I'd really like my ability to write
    (small) apps outside of the framework way of thinking
* Meta Programming
    - Necessary for understanding and writing more general software
